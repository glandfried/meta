Your job before the application stage is to find all the great reasons to go to a place. 
Realize all of the great collaborations you'll have with your potential future colleagues.
The goal durnig an interview is to be curious, to find connections, and to explore.

- Talk about your research, 1-2 minute overview of your research and open to FAQs
- Be honest about their university, and give some of the reasons you would like to go there: the people, the city, family connections to the area, whatever it is. If arenâ€™t open to even considering go, then tell them that.

Make it easy for the audience to remember the main point of the talk, and make it easy for them to ask questions about the things you most want to talk about.
