The primary content-type, the *Data Descriptor*, combines traditional narrative content with curated, structured descriptions (metadata) of data to provide a new framework for data sharing and reuse. These principles are designed to align with and support the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) for scientific data management and stewardship, which declare that research data should be **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable** and **Reusable**.
