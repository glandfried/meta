# Meta repository

This repository aims to organize all my academic work. It contains essentially only "README" files, and submodules.

### Lines of Work

- Science as an intercultural project of intersubjective agreements
- Bayesian inference as the way to compute honest beliefs
- Culture as transgenerational information, a product of a non-ergodic system
- Colonial-modernity as the event of massive loss of adapted knowledge
- Polycentric governance as a means for ecological re-adaptation

Empathy is the cognitive skill that allowed the development of Homo sapiens: mutual understanding, imitation, language and finally culture.
Intellectual honesty is a generalization of empathy on which the (ideal of) scientific development is based, a principle common to the entire human species.
Only recently have it been discovered which rules allow us to compute honest-beliefs distributions,  ensuring consistent and optimal reasoning in contexts of uncertainty given the available information.
While these formalisms are a useful tool for the intercultural project of intersubjective agreements, only the transgenerational information produced by societies (culture) is ecologically adapted.
The current ecological crisis was preceded by an era of genocide and cultural loss, and is being aggravated by the advance of state-private institutions of the patriarchal-colonial-modern front over local autonomies, preventing communities from developing their own institutions.
In a world of uprooted individuals, a pedagogy of cruelty manages to introduce the typical psychopathic structure of our times, the instrumental desire and a worldview of things, nature as a thing, people as things.
Systems that are out of equilibrium, such as the ecological one, offer a physical advantage for cooperation.
Rescuing domestic policy, a knowledge accumulated by women in their condition as a differentiated group of the species, is essential to face the ecological crisis.
